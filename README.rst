bananaBread: A Bot for Discord
==============================

**bananaBread** is a Python library for managing a Discord Bot

Scripts are written in Python 3.9.7

This project is under active development.

Identified problems:

* pdoc3 cannot document most of the functions in ``handle_discord``. Refer to script until fixed.

* Due to an error yet unknown, media downloads are sometimes halted, but does not break the code. Check terminal to ensure there is no error until it is fixed.

**Currently supported modules are**

    #.``pydiscmd``

    #.``getmedia``
